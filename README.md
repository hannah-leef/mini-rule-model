# Mini Rule Model

This is a small Python project I made to play around with rule-based simulations in a medical-ish setting. The goal was to see how a simple rule language could be parsed and then used to update a system step by step over time.
It’s not meant to be a full framework — just a lightweight experiment that helped me think about how rules, state, and simulation fit together.
